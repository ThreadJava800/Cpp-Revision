 # Cpp-Revision
Getting ready for university, repeating c++
I didn't use c++ for a long time, so i'm trying to recall it in my memory :)
Also trying to get into algorithms!

## 1.cpp
Just revising how to create "Hello, world" in c++
## 2.cpp
Partially finished long arithmetics, repeating how to overload operators
## 3.cpp
Started to dive into algorithms, [first exercise](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1068/) - basic (**Weird algorithm**).
## 4.cpp
[Second exercise](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1083) - basic (**Missing number**).
## 5.cpp
[Third exercise](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1094/) - basic (**Increasing numbers**).
## 6.cpp
Repeated **binary search**.
## 7.cpp
Repeated **quick sort**, realised in basic sort() function in c++ library of <algorithm>.
