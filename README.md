 # Cpp-Revision
Getting ready for university, repeating c++
I didn't use c++ for a long time, so i'm trying to recall it in my memory :)
Also trying to get into algorithms!

## 1.cpp
Just revising how to create "Hello, world" in c++
## 2.cpp
Partially finished long ariphmetics, repeating how to overload operators
